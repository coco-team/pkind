=============
Requirements
=============

KIND relies on the following systems/solvers:

1. OCaml (version 3.11.2 or greater). More information can be found at http://www.ocaml.org.

2. An MPI implementation: 
    * OPENMPI (http://www.open-mpi.org/)

3. A compatible SMT solver:
     * Yices, available at http://yices.csl.sri.com/
         Get the latest version, with GMP statically linked
         (this requires a click-through license agreement)
   
4. The GNU Autoconf tool (http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)

5. python 2.7

6. python library: pyparsing

=================
Required packages
=================

KIND relies on the following OCaml libraries:

  * ExtLib: Extended library for OCaml
  * OcamlMpi: Mpi wrapper for OCaml

If not present, both libraries will be installed in the './lib' directory.


======================================
Configuration and Installation of KIND
======================================

The './configure' script examines your system and checks for the
required packages and solvers. The script has some options, that can
be listed using the command './configure --help'.

The script is generated locally by running 

  > autoconf

If you would like to compile and install Kind with the Yices wrapper (which is recommended), 
issue the following command:

  > ./configure  --with-yicesw --with-yices-dir=[YICES DIR]

If you would like to compile and install KIND in a local directory, issue the following command:

  > ./configure --prefix=[LOCAL-DIR] --with-yicesw --with-yices-dir=[YICES DIR]

If the configuration process was successful, it will generate the
necessary Makefile. 

To compile KIND:
  
  > make

To install KIND:

  > make install  

if you have write permissions in the install directory. Otherwise:

  > sudo make install 


If you have configured and installed KIND in a local directory 
(i.e. by using --prefix=[LOCAL-DIR] in ./configure); 
you need to add the [LOCAL-DIR] to your system path.


============
SMT Solvers
============

The default operation of Kind uses a wrapper version of the Yices solver.
The wrapper is written in C and, when compiled, calls the Yices (statically
linked) library.  Yices command line version's interactive mode is limited 
in the size of formulas it can accept.  Depending on the version of Yices 
you use, you may need to upgrade your compiler version.
