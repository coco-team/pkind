Test Generation




* To generate test cases using BMC with pkind
  > python dist/pkind.py -f [LUSTRE_FILE] -c [TESTCONDITIONS]
   - TESTCONDITIONS : they have to be in " ", e.g. "a = b"


* To generate a test case which kills a mutant based on invariants
  > python dist/pkind.py -inv -f [ORIGINAL_FILE] -mu [MUTATED_FILE]
